# Task. Image gallery

Create a gallery with the ability to click on its elements and view the full-size image in a modal window. Watch pictures of the gallery.

- The live page displays a gallery of images from the images array
- The image gallery is styled according to the layout
- The data for the gallery is generated dynamically in JS
- When listening for the click event on gallery items, delegation is used
- Nothing happens when you click between gallery items
- The basicLightbox library is connected
- When you click on a gallery element, a modal window of the connected library opens, which contains an enlarged version of the clicked image
